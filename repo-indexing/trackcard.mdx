# TrackCard Components

## Overview

### Purpose

Use this component to generate music track card functionality

### When to Use

The TrackCard component is designed for music applications where you need to display track information in a visually appealing card format. Use this component when:

- Building music streaming interfaces or music library displays
- Creating playlists or music collection views
- Displaying track metadata with visual elements
- Building music discovery or recommendation interfaces
- Creating responsive music galleries that work across different screen sizes
- Implementing music-focused carousels or grid layouts

### Architecture

**No Coupling**: This is a standalone component that can be used independently without requiring specific parent components or shared context.

The TrackCard component follows a self-contained architecture that:

- Manages its own image loading and error states
- Integrates with external image APIs for dynamic cover art
- Uses shadcn Card components for consistent styling
- Provides responsive design out of the box
- Handles accessibility concerns with proper alt text and semantic structure

### Component Interdependencies

This component has no coupling requirements and can be used independently. However, it does depend on:

- Next.js Image component for optimized image rendering
- shadcn Card components for layout structure
- External image API for dynamic cover art generation

## Components

### TrackCard

**Purpose:** Displays music track information in a card format with cover art, title, artist, label, and release date.

**Interface:**

```typescript
export interface Track {
  id: string; // Unique identifier for the track
  title: string; // Track title/name
  artist: string; // Artist or performer name
  label?: string; // Record label (optional)
  releaseDate?: string; // Release date/year (optional)
  imageQuery?: string; // Custom image search query (optional, defaults to title)
}

interface TrackCardProps {
  track: Track; // Track data object containing all track information
  className?: string; // Additional CSS classes for customization
}
```

**Key Features:**

- Dynamic image loading with fallback handling
- Responsive design with consistent dimensions
- Hover effects for interactive feedback
- Truncated text to prevent layout overflow
- Semantic HTML structure for accessibility

**Usage Example:**

```tsx
import { TrackCard, Track } from "@/components/music/TrackCard";

function MusicLibrary() {
  const track: Track = {
    id: "track-1",
    title: "Deep House Vibes",
    artist: "DJ Producer",
    label: "House Records",
    releaseDate: "2024",
    imageQuery: "deep house music studio",
  };

  return <TrackCard track={track} className="max-w-sm" />;
}
```

## Integration Patterns

### Basic Usage

```tsx
import { TrackCard, Track } from "@/components/music/TrackCard";

// Minimal track data
const basicTrack: Track = {
  id: "basic-track",
  title: "Summer Groove",
  artist: "Beach Beats",
};

function BasicExample() {
  return <TrackCard track={basicTrack} />;
}
```

### Complete Track Information

```tsx
// Full track data with all optional fields
const completeTrack: Track = {
  id: "complete-track",
  title: "Midnight Runner",
  artist: "Synthwave Masters",
  label: "Retro Records",
  releaseDate: "2024",
  imageQuery: "synthwave neon city midnight",
};

function CompleteExample() {
  return (
    <TrackCard
      track={completeTrack}
      className="shadow-xl hover:shadow-2xl transition-all duration-300"
    />
  );
}
```

### Grid Layout Integration

```tsx
import { TrackCard, Track } from "@/components/music/TrackCard";

function TrackGrid({ tracks }: { tracks: Track[] }) {
  return (
    <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4 gap-4">
      {tracks.map((track) => (
        <TrackCard key={track.id} track={track} className="w-full" />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Carousel Integration

```tsx
import { TrackCard, Track } from "@/components/music/TrackCard";
import {
  Carousel,
  CarouselContent,
  CarouselItem,
} from "@/components/ui/carousel";

function TrackCarousel({ tracks }: { tracks: Track[] }) {
  return (
    <Carousel className="w-full">
      <CarouselContent>
        {tracks.map((track) => (
          <CarouselItem
            key={track.id}
            className="md:basis-1/2 lg:basis-1/3 xl:basis-1/4"
          >
            <TrackCard track={track} />
          </CarouselItem>
        ))}
      </CarouselContent>
    </Carousel>
  );
}
```

## Best Practices

### Usage Guidelines

- Always provide a unique `id` for each track to ensure proper React key handling
- Use descriptive `imageQuery` values to get better cover art from the image API
- Keep track titles and artist names concise to prevent layout issues with text truncation
- Consider the container width when using multiple TrackCards to ensure proper responsive behavior

### Accessibility

- The component automatically generates descriptive alt text for cover images using track title
- Card structure uses semantic HTML with proper heading hierarchy
- Hover states provide visual feedback for interactive elements
- Text truncation ensures content remains readable across different screen sizes

### Performance

- Images are loaded with Next.js Image component for automatic optimization
- Error handling prevents broken image states from affecting user experience
- The component includes proper sizing hints for responsive image loading
- Lazy loading is enabled by default for images not immediately visible

### Image Optimization

- Provide specific `imageQuery` values for better cover art relevance
- The fallback state displays the track title when images fail to load
- Consider the image API rate limits when displaying large numbers of tracks simultaneously

## Common Patterns

### Music Genre Collections

```tsx
// Organizing tracks by genre with section headers
function GenreSection({ genre, tracks }: { genre: string; tracks: Track[] }) {
  return (
    <section>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">{genre}</h2>
      <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-3 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-4">
        {tracks.map((track) => (
          <TrackCard key={track.id} track={track} />
        ))}
      </div>
    </section>
  );
}
```

### Interactive Track Cards

```tsx
// Adding click handlers for track selection or playback
function InteractiveTrackCard({
  track,
  onPlay,
}: {
  track: Track;
  onPlay: (track: Track) => void;
}) {
  return (
    <div onClick={() => onPlay(track)} className="cursor-pointer">
      <TrackCard
        track={track}
        className="hover:scale-105 transition-transform duration-200"
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Responsive Track Layouts

```tsx
// Adaptive layouts that work across different screen sizes
function ResponsiveTrackLayout({ tracks }: { tracks: Track[] }) {
  return (
    <div className="grid grid-cols-2 sm:grid-cols-3 md:grid-cols-4 lg:grid-cols-5 xl:grid-cols-6 gap-2 md:gap-4">
      {tracks.map((track) => (
        <TrackCard key={track.id} track={track} className="aspect-square" />
      ))}
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Custom Styling Variations

```tsx
// Different visual styles for different contexts
function StyledTrackCards() {
  const track = { id: "1", title: "Example", artist: "Artist" };

  return (
    <div className="space-y-4">
      {/* Compact version */}
      <TrackCard track={track} className="h-48 w-48" />

      {/* Featured version */}
      <TrackCard track={track} className="h-80 w-64 border-2 border-primary" />

      {/* Minimal version */}
      <TrackCard
        track={track}
        className="h-56 shadow-none border border-muted"
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```
